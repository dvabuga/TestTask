# TestTask
-solution was tested on expressions like:
x^2 + 3.5xy + y = y^2 - xy + y;

3a^6y^2 -2x + x^2 + y + 2 + 3 = -x^2 + 4y - 1 + 3.5xy

-solution does not supports expressions with brackets like (a-b);

-solution does not support fractions like a/b


Code was not covered by unit tests because of lack of the time.
If it is necessary to extend the implementation - I am ready.
